# MPhys2025
Common repository for 2025-26 MPhys work

# Learning outcomes
* Proficiency in PyTorch (possibly extending to tools like PyTorch-Lightning)
* Proficiency in data analysis for particle physics with Scikit-HEP stack
* Building ML models for various HEP tasks
* Deploying large models on GPUs
* Possibly generating simulated datasets

# Possible research outcomes
* Test and benchmark different tools for classifying various specific processes
* Applying and extending these tools to multi-class classification
* Apply masked transformer idea for reconstructing arbitrary heavy resonance particle kinematics
* Comparing both of the above techniques to the HyPER tool
* Testing transformer regression for ttbar spin measurements [direct SDM elements, direct top kinematics]
* Adding in generative techniques for ttbar spin measurements

# Tutorials and documentation
#### Intro to ML 4 Physicists (by Ethan) [here](https://github.com/els285/Intro2NN4Physics/tree/main)
Covers:
  * Using the scikit-hep stack for HEP data analysis
  * Pedagogical introduction to classical ML with PyTorch
  * Building a DNN with PyTorch for signal/background classification

#### PyTorch Tutorials
[PyTorch](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/)
[PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/starter/introduction.html)

#### Manchester resources
[Manchester Computational Shared Facility](https://ri.itservices.manchester.ac.uk/csf3) - UoM computing infrastructure with access to GPUs
I will get you set up here in due course.

# Literature


# Working practices
This research will be computationally heavy, and we will do everything in Python. Recommend to be comfortable working in iPython notebooks (Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, VSCode).
Recommend using VSCode or similar IDE for coding (VSCode is the best). Will also need access to a terminal (CLI).
