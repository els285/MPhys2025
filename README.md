# MPhys2025
Common repository for 2025-26 MPhys work

# Learning Outcomes
* Proficiency in PyTorch (possibly extending to tools like PyTorch-Lightning)
* Proficiency in data analysis for particle physics with Scikit-HEP stack
* Building ML models for various HEP tasks
* Deploying large models on GPUs
* Possibly generating simulated datasets

# Possible Research Outcomes
* Test and benchmark different tools for classifying various specific processes
* Applying and extending these tools to multi-class classification
* Apply masked transformer idea for reconstructing arbitrary heavy resonance particle kinematics
* Comparing both of the above techniques to the HyPER tool
* Testing transformer regression for ttbar spin measurements [direct SDM elements, direct top kinematics]
* Adding in generative techniques for ttbar spin measurements
